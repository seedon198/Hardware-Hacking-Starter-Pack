# Advanced Techniques: Decapsulation and Microprobing

When conventional reverse engineering methods reach their limits, hardware hackers turn to more sophisticated techniques. Decapsulation, microprobing, and other advanced approaches allow direct access to the silicon die inside integrated circuits, revealing details invisible through external analysis. These techniques represent the cutting edge of hardware hacking, opening new possibilities for security research and functional analysis.

## Beyond the Package

Most reverse engineering focuses on connections between components, analyzing the PCB and external interfaces. However, modern security vulnerabilities and interesting design features often exist within the integrated circuits themselves. To access these, we need to look beneath the plastic packaging that protects semiconductor dies.

This journey into the microscopic world requires specialized tools and techniques, but modern advances have made these approaches increasingly accessible to determined hardware hackers. While these methods carry higher risks of permanently damaging the target device, they often provide insights unavailable through any other means.

## IC Decapsulation Fundamentals

Decapsulation exposes the silicon die inside an integrated circuit by removing its protective packaging. This delicate process requires precision and care—the goal is to remove the package material without damaging the fragile chip inside or the tiny bond wires connecting it to the package pins.

Several decapsulation methods exist, each with distinct advantages and applications:

### Chemical Decapsulation

Chemical decapsulation uses concentrated acids to dissolve the packaging material without harming the silicon:

1. **Preparation**: Create a small opening in the package above the area of interest, often by mechanically grinding or drilling carefully.

2. **Acid application**: Apply concentrated acid (typically fuming nitric acid for plastic packages or sulfuric acid for certain materials) to dissolve the packaging. 

3. **Neutralization and cleaning**: Once sufficient material is removed, neutralize the acid and clean the exposed die.

While effective, this method requires extreme caution due to the hazardous chemicals involved. Proper ventilation, safety equipment, and acid handling procedures are absolutely essential. Many hardware hackers use commercial decapsulation systems that contain the chemicals and fumes safely, though DIY approaches exist for those with appropriate safety measures.

The primary advantage of chemical decapsulation is its ability to preserve delicate bond wires and surface structures, making it ideal for functional analysis where the circuit must remain operational after exposure.

### Thermal Decapsulation

Thermal methods use controlled heat to remove packaging material:

1. **Controlled heating**: Using a hot air rework station or specialized decapping tool, heat the package to a temperature that weakens the plastic without damaging the silicon.

2. **Mechanical removal**: While heated, carefully remove softened packaging material using precision tools.

3. **Cleaning**: Clean residual material with appropriate solvents.

This approach avoids dangerous acids but requires precise temperature control to prevent damage to the die or bond wires. It works best for smaller packages and when partial access is sufficient.

### Plasma Decapsulation

Plasma systems use ionized gas to etch away packaging material:

1. **Chamber preparation**: Place the IC in a vacuum chamber and introduce specific gases.

2. **Plasma generation**: Create a plasma that chemically reacts with the packaging material.

3. **Controlled etching**: The plasma gradually removes packaging without mechanical stress.

This sophisticated method offers excellent control and minimal risk to the die, but requires specialized and expensive equipment typically found in professional labs rather than hobbyist workshops.

### Mechanical Decapsulation

The most straightforward approach uses physical tools to remove packaging:

1. **Controlled milling**: Use a precision milling machine or rotary tool to carefully remove package material.

2. **Polishing**: Gradually polish the surface to expose the die without damaging it.

3. **Final cleaning**: Remove debris with compressed air and gentle solvents.

While mechanical methods require less hazardous materials, they carry higher risks of damaging the die or bond wires through physical contact. This approach works best for packages with significant space between the surface and the die.

## Microprobing Techniques

Once the silicon die is exposed, microprobing allows direct interaction with its circuits, accessing signals unavailable at the package pins.

### Microprobing Equipment

Several specialized tools enable effective microprobing:

**Micromanipulators** provide extremely fine position control, allowing precise probe placement on microscopic circuit traces. These devices use micrometer screws or piezoelectric controllers to move in three dimensions with sub-micron precision.

**Probe tips** come in various styles depending on the application. Passive probes simply make electrical contact, while active probes include buffers to minimize loading effects on sensitive circuits. The tips themselves must be incredibly sharp, often just a few microns wide at the contact point.

**Microscopy systems** provide the necessary visualization. While basic work might use a good stereomicroscope, serious microprobing typically requires higher magnification from digital microscopes or even scanning electron microscopes for the smallest geometries.

**Analytical equipment** connects to the probes to capture and interpret signals. This might include oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, or specialized test equipment depending on the target circuitry.

### Probing Process

The microprobing process demands patience and steady hands:

1. **Target identification**: Using chip documentation (if available) or visual analysis, identify the circuit nodes you wish to probe. Metal traces, bond pads, and test points on the die provide accessible contact points.

2. **Probe positioning**: Under microscopic guidance, carefully position the probe tip over the target node. This requires extremely fine adjustments and vibration isolation.

3. **Contact establishment**: Gently lower the probe until it makes contact with the target. This delicate operation risks damaging both the probe tip and the die if done hastily.

4. **Signal acquisition**: Once contact is established, connect the probe to appropriate measurement equipment to observe signals or inject test patterns.

For complex analysis, multiple probes might contact different points simultaneously, allowing observation of relationships between signals or creation of custom test conditions.

### Challenges and Considerations

Microprobing presents several unique challenges:

**Scale mismatch** makes precise positioning difficult—human hands moving manipulators that must position probes with micron-level accuracy requires practice and patience.

**Mechanical stability** is crucial, as even minor vibrations can cause the probe to slip or damage the die. Professional systems use vibration-isolated tables, while DIY approaches might employ improvised damping systems.

**Circuit loading** occurs when connecting probes to active circuits. The probe's electrical characteristics can affect the circuit being measured, potentially changing its behavior. Active probes with high impedance and low capacitance help minimize this effect.

**Surface preparation** often requires removing passivation layers—protective coatings that cover the die's surface. These can be removed with careful application of hydrofluoric acid or plasma etching, though this adds complexity and risk.

## Imaging and Analysis

Once the die is exposed, several imaging techniques help analyze its structure and function:

### Optical Microscopy

Standard optical microscopy provides the simplest approach to die analysis:

1. **Surface examination**: Observe the die's floorplan, identifying major functional blocks and interconnection patterns.

2. **Layer identification**: Different layers often appear as distinct colors under proper lighting.

3. **Documentation**: Capture high-resolution images for further analysis and reference.

While limited by the wavelength of light, good optical microscopy reveals substantial information about modern chips, especially larger process nodes (90nm and above). Digital microscopes with image stacking capabilities help overcome depth-of-field limitations at high magnification.

### Electron Microscopy

For more detailed analysis, electron microscopy offers superior resolution:

**Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)** uses an electron beam to image surface details at nanometer scales. SEM excels at revealing fine structures invisible to optical microscopes and can identify manufacturing technologies and potential security features.

**Focused Ion Beam (FIB) systems** combine imaging capabilities with the ability to cut and modify the die itself. This powerful tool enables cross-sectional analysis and circuit modification but requires significant expertise and expensive equipment typically found in professional labs.

### Logic Analysis Through Imaging

Visual examination of powered circuits can reveal operational characteristics:

**Infrared imaging** detects heat patterns during operation, highlighting active areas and potential hotspots. This non-invasive technique helps identify active regions during specific operations.

**Photon emission analysis** detects the faint light emitted when transistors switch states. Specialized equipment can capture these emissions, creating maps of circuit activity during operation.

**Voltage contrast imaging** in an electron microscope reveals voltage differences across the chip by detecting variations in secondary electron emission. This technique can identify powered regions and some logical states without direct contact.

## Fault Injection at Die Level

Direct access to the die enables sophisticated fault injection techniques:

### Laser Fault Injection

Focused laser pulses can induce transient faults in specific circuit areas:

1. **Target identification**: Identify sensitive circuits through documentation or preliminary analysis.

2. **Laser focusing**: Position and focus a laser system precisely on the target area.

3. **Synchronized triggering**: Time the laser pulse to coincide with specific operations.

4. **Effect analysis**: Observe how induced faults affect device behavior.

This technique can bypass security measures by causing calculation errors or state transitions at critical moments. The precision of modern laser systems allows targeting individual transistors in some cases.

### Physical Circuit Editing

FIB systems enable direct modification of circuit structures:

1. **Circuit analysis**: Identify the specific connections to modify.

2. **Precision cutting**: Use the focused ion beam to cut specific metal traces on the die.

3. **Deposition**: Optionally, deposit conductive material to create new connections.

4. **Verification**: Test the modified circuit's functionality.

This advanced technique directly alters the chip's function, potentially bypassing security features or enabling access to protected functionality. While requiring sophisticated equipment, it demonstrates that hardware security ultimately depends on physical access controls.

## Case Study: Security Analysis Through Decapsulation

To illustrate these techniques, consider how they might apply to analyzing a secure microcontroller:

A hardware security researcher suspects that a microcontroller's advertised secure boot implementation contains vulnerabilities. After conventional analysis reaches its limits, they proceed with advanced techniques:

1. **Target preparation**: They identify the main processor package and research its likely internal structure.

2. **Chemical decapsulation**: Using fuming nitric acid in a controlled apparatus, they carefully remove the packaging material above the processor die.

3. **Initial inspection**: Under microscopic examination, they identify major functional blocks, including what appears to be secure boot ROM and memory protection circuits.

4. **Passive analysis**: High-resolution imaging documents the chip's layout for comparison with known architectures and identification of potential weak points.

5. **Active probing**: Using micromanipulator-positioned probes, they monitor specific signal lines during the boot process, identifying the communication between the boot ROM and flash memory.

6. **Fault injection testing**: After identifying timing-critical verification steps, they apply laser pulses during specific instructions, successfully causing the processor to skip security checks.

7. **Validation**: They develop a practical attack based on their findings, demonstrating a security vulnerability that allows unauthorized firmware execution.

8. **Responsible disclosure**: Following ethical practices, they report the vulnerability to the manufacturer before publishing their findings.

This hypothetical case demonstrates how advanced techniques provide insights unavailable through conventional analysis, particularly in security-focused applications.

## DIY Approaches to Advanced Analysis

While professional equipment for these techniques costs tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, determined hobbyists have developed more accessible approaches:

### Budget-Conscious Decapsulation

Several approaches make basic decapsulation more accessible:

1. **Acid containment systems**: Simple 3D-printed fixtures can safely hold small amounts of acid for controlled application.

2. **Thermal methods**: Modified hot air rework stations provide sufficient heat for thermal decapsulation of smaller packages.

3. **Mechanical approaches**: Precision rotary tools with appropriate bits allow careful material removal under microscopic guidance.

Always remember that safety remains paramount—improvised equipment must still provide proper protection against chemical exposure, fumes, and other hazards.

### Affordable Microprobing

Basic microprobing becomes more accessible through:

1. **Adapted micromanipulators**: While professional units cost thousands, simpler versions provide sufficient precision for larger process nodes.

2. **Digital microscopes**: Consumer-grade digital microscopes with 200-500x magnification enable work on many modern chips.

3. **Custom probe tips**: Sharpened tungsten wire or modified acupuncture needles can serve as improvised probe tips for larger features.

4. **3D-printed fixtures**: Custom-designed holders and platforms stabilize both the target and probes.

These approaches won't match the capabilities of professional labs but still enable meaningful analysis of many commercial devices.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

Advanced hardware analysis techniques raise important ethical and legal questions:

**Intellectual property concerns** are significant when examining proprietary designs at the die level. Many jurisdictions have specific laws regarding reverse engineering for interoperability versus competitive purposes.

**Security research exemptions** exist in some regions, allowing certain types of analysis for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. However, these protections vary significantly between countries.

**Responsible disclosure** practices become particularly important when these techniques reveal security vulnerabilities. Established protocols involve notifying manufacturers before public disclosure, allowing time for patches or mitigations.

**Safety requirements** must be rigorously followed, especially regarding chemical handling, electrical safety, and proper disposal of hazardous materials.

Always research applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction before undertaking advanced hardware analysis.

## Conclusion

Decapsulation, microprobing, and related techniques represent the frontier of hardware hacking, revealing secrets hidden within the silicon itself. While these approaches require specialized skills and equipment, they demonstrate that determined researchers can access virtually any aspect of electronic systems given sufficient resources and expertise.

For hardware security professionals, understanding these capabilities informs better protection strategies. For hobbyists and researchers, they represent fascinating, if challenging, methods to explore the microscopic world of modern electronics.

As manufacturing technologies advance toward smaller process nodes, these techniques grow more challenging—yet the fundamental approaches remain valid even as specific implementations evolve. The cat-and-mouse game between security designers and hardware hackers continues to drive innovation on both sides.

This concludes our exploration of reverse engineering techniques. In our next section, we'll examine [Embedded Device Security](./09-embedded-security.md), building on these fundamentals to understand how modern devices protect (or fail to protect) their critical functionality.
