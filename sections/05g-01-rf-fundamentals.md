# RF Physics for Hardware Hackers

## Overview

Radio Frequency (RF) fundamentals form the physical foundation of all wireless protocols. Before diving into specific wireless technologies, hardware hackers must understand the physics, engineering principles, and terminology that govern electromagnetic communications.

## Core RF Concepts

### Frequency Bands and Their Properties

1. **Common Frequency Bands**
   - **Sub-GHz Bands**
     - 433 MHz (ISM band): Common for remote controls, sensors, garage door openers
     - 868 MHz (Europe) / 915 MHz (USA): IoT devices, smart meters, alarm systems
   - **Microwave Bands**
     - 2.4 GHz (ISM band): WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, microwave ovens
     - 5 GHz (ISM/UNII bands): WiFi, radar systems
   - **Cellular Bands**
     - 700-900 MHz: LTE, GSM
     - 1700-2100 MHz: UMTS, AWS
     - 2.5-2.7 GHz: LTE, 5G NR
     - 3.3-4.2 GHz, 24-40 GHz: 5G mmWave
   - **Specialized Bands**
     - 125/134 kHz: LF RFID, animal tracking
     - 13.56 MHz: HF RFID, NFC
     - 315 MHz: Car remotes (North America)
     - 860-960 MHz: UHF RFID

2. **Regulatory Considerations**
   - FCC (USA), ETSI (Europe), and international regulatory frameworks
   - Licensed vs. unlicensed spectrum
   - Transmission power limits by frequency band
   - Duty cycle restrictions (especially in Europe)
   - Testing and certification requirements

3. **Physical Properties by Frequency**
   - Lower frequencies: Better penetration, longer range, lower data rates
   - Higher frequencies: Line-of-sight requirements, shorter range, higher data rates
   - Absorption characteristics (water, building materials)
   - Reflection, diffraction, and scattering behaviors

### Modulation Techniques

1. **Amplitude-Based Modulation**

   Amplitude modulation represents the simplest approach to encoding digital data, manipulating the strength (amplitude) of the carrier signal to represent different bit values.
   
   ```
   OOK Modulation (Bit Pattern: 1 0 1 1 0 1 0)
   
   Carrier:  /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
   
   OOK:      /\/\/\/\        /\/\/\/\/\/\      /\/\/\/\
             ───────────────────────────────────────────▶
                1     0     1     1     0     1     0
   ```
   
   - **On-Off Keying (OOK)**: The simplest form of digital modulation, where the presence of a carrier wave represents a '1' bit and its absence represents a '0' bit. This is essentially turning the signal on and off, like a light switch. OOK is commonly used in:
     * Garage door openers
     * Simple remote controls
     * Weather sensors
     * RFID tags
     * Tire pressure monitoring systems
   
   - **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)**: An extension of OOK that uses multiple amplitude levels to encode different symbols. Instead of just on/off, the signal might have several different strength levels, allowing more data to be transmitted in the same time period.
   
   - **Hardware implementations**: The simplicity of amplitude modulation allows for straightforward receiver designs:
     * Envelope detectors (essentially diode + capacitor) can recover the signal
     * Low power requirements make it ideal for battery-operated devices
     * Minimal components needed for implementation
     * Often vulnerable to noise and interference
   
   **Security Implications**: Due to their simplicity, amplitude-based modulation schemes are among the most vulnerable to attack:
   - Trivial to detect with basic SDR equipment
   - Highly susceptible to replay attacks
   - Often implemented without encryption
   - Easily jammed even with low-power interferers

2. **Frequency-Based Modulation**

   Frequency modulation encodes data by varying the frequency of the carrier signal rather than its amplitude. This provides greater resistance to noise and interference, making it more robust for real-world applications.
   
   ```
   Binary FSK Modulation (Bit Pattern: 1 0 1 1 0 1 0)
   
   Bit Value:      1     0     1     1     0     1     0

   Frequency:  ────┘     └─────┘     │     └─────┘     └─────

   Signal:    /\/\/\~~~~~//\/\/\/\/\/\~~~~~//\/\/\~~~~~

                f₁    f₀    f₁    f₁    f₀    f₁    f₀
   ```
   
   | FSK Type | Description | Common Applications | Security Considerations |
   |----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
   | Binary FSK | Two frequencies representing '0' and '1' | Weather stations, Pagers, Medical telemetry | Relatively easy to intercept and analyze |
   | Multiple FSK | More than two frequencies for higher data rates | Maritime communications, Some utility meters | Requires more complex hardware to intercept |
   | Gaussian FSK | Filtered FSK reducing spectral width | Bluetooth Classic, DECT cordless phones | More difficult to detect at greater distances |
   | Minimum Shift Keying | Special case where frequencies are closely spaced | Satellite communications, GSM | Requires precise signal analysis equipment |
   
   - **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**: Data is represented by shifts between discrete frequencies, with each frequency corresponding to a specific symbol or bit pattern.
   
   - **Binary FSK (BFSK)**: The simplest form, using two different frequencies (f₁ and f₀) to represent binary '1' and '0'. A practical example is found in amateur radio RTTY (radioteletype) which uses 170 Hz shift between mark and space frequencies.
   
   - **Multiple FSK (MFSK)**: Uses more than two frequencies to encode multiple bits per symbol. For example, 4-FSK uses four different frequencies, allowing two bits to be encoded in each symbol, doubling the data rate compared to BFSK.
   
   - **Gaussian FSK (GFSK)**: A variant where the modulating signal is passed through a Gaussian filter before modulation, smoothing transitions between frequencies. This reduces the spectral width, allowing more efficient use of bandwidth. Bluetooth Classic notably uses GFSK.
   
   - **Hardware considerations**:
     * Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) circuits are commonly used for both modulation and demodulation
     * Frequency discriminators convert frequency variations back to data
     * More complex than amplitude modulation but offers better performance
     * Modern implementations often use digital signal processing rather than analog circuits
   
   **Security Implications**:
   - More resistant to interference than amplitude modulation
   - Higher implementation complexity creates additional attack surfaces
   - SDR equipment can still easily capture and analyze signals
   - Commercial systems like Bluetooth implement additional security layers on top of the basic modulation

3. **Phase-Based Modulation**

   Phase modulation encodes data by changing the phase of the carrier signal while maintaining constant frequency and amplitude. This technique offers superior noise immunity and spectral efficiency compared to amplitude and frequency modulation methods.
   
   ```

   | PSK Type | Phase States | Bits per Symbol | Typical Applications | Security Considerations |
   |----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
   | BPSK | 2 (0°, 180°) | 1 | GPS, Deep-space, Low-rate WiFi | Most robust but lowest data rate |
   | QPSK | 4 (45°, 135°, 225°, 315°) | 2 | Satellite, Modern cellular | Good balance of robustness and data rate |
   | 8-PSK | 8 | 3 | Digital broadcasting, High-rate applications | Higher data rate but more susceptible to noise |
   | DPSK | Various | Varies | RFID, Mobile communications | More resistant to certain phase ambiguities |
   | QAM-PSK hybrids | 16, 64, 256+ | 4, 6, 8+ | Modern WiFi, 5G, Cable modems | Higher capacity but requires excellent SNR |
   
   - **Phase Shift Keying (PSK)**: A digital modulation scheme that conveys data by changing the phase of the carrier wave. The demodulator determines the phase of the received signal and maps it back to the symbol it represents.
   
   - **Binary PSK (BPSK)**: The simplest form of PSK, using two phases (typically 0° and 180°) to represent binary digits. BPSK is extremely robust in noisy environments, making it ideal for:
     * GPS satellite signals
     * Deep-space communications
     * Low data rate WiFi transmission modes
     * Military communications requiring high reliability
   
   - **Quadrature PSK (QPSK)**: Uses four different phase states (typically 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°), enabling the transmission of two bits per symbol. This doubles the data rate compared to BPSK without increasing bandwidth. Applications include:
     * Satellite communications
     * CDMA cellular systems
     * Digital video broadcasting
     * Cable modems
   
   - **Differential PSK (DPSK)**: Rather than encoding absolute phase, DPSK encodes information in the phase transitions. The current symbol's phase is interpreted relative to the previous symbol, eliminating the need for a coherent reference signal at the receiver. This simplifies receiver design but with slightly reduced performance compared to coherent PSK.
   
   - **Higher-Order PSK**: Systems such as 8-PSK and 16-PSK use more phase states to encode additional bits per symbol, increasing data rates at the expense of noise tolerance.
   
   - **Hardware complexity**:
     * I/Q modulators and demodulators (using two carriers 90° out of phase)
     * Phase-locked loops for coherent detection
     * Digital signal processing for symbol recovery
     * More sophisticated RF front-ends for maintaining phase accuracy
   
   **Security Implications**:
   - Higher immunity to simple interference compared to amplitude modulation
   - Phase accuracy requirements may create timing-based side channels
   - Advanced SDR equipment capable of phase analysis required for interception
   - Modern communications combine PSK with encryption for security

4. **Combined Techniques**

   Modern digital communications often combine multiple modulation approaches to optimize the trade-off between spectral efficiency and robustness. The most common combined technique is Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), which merges aspects of both amplitude and phase modulation.
   
   ```

                │
   ```
   
   | QAM Order | Constellation Points | Bits per Symbol | SNR Required | Typical Applications |
   |-----------|----------------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
   | 16-QAM    | 16 (4×4 grid)        | 4               | ~15 dB       | WiFi, Cable TV, Digital radio |
   | 64-QAM    | 64 (8×8 grid)        | 6               | ~22 dB       | DVB-T, 802.11a/g/n, DOCSIS 3.0 |
   | 256-QAM   | 256 (16×16 grid)     | 8               | ~28 dB       | DVB-C, 802.11ac, DOCSIS 3.1 |
   | 1024-QAM  | 1024 (32×32 grid)    | 10              | ~35 dB       | 802.11ax (WiFi 6), Advanced cable systems |
   | 4096-QAM  | 4096 (64×64 grid)    | 12              | ~41 dB       | Next-gen fixed links, WiFi 7 |
   
   - **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)**: Combines amplitude and phase modulation by independently modulating two carrier waves that are 90° out of phase (in quadrature). Each symbol represents multiple bits, significantly increasing data rates within the same bandwidth.
   
   - **Higher-Order QAM**: As modulation order increases, more bits can be encoded per symbol:
     * **16-QAM**: Uses 16 different combinations of amplitude and phase, encoding 4 bits per symbol
     * **64-QAM**: Uses 64 different combinations, encoding 6 bits per symbol
     * **256-QAM**: Uses 256 different combinations, encoding 8 bits per symbol
     * **1024-QAM**: Uses 1024 different combinations, encoding 10 bits per symbol
   
   - **Hardware implementation considerations**:
     * As modulation order increases, receivers need increasingly precise analog components
     * Higher-order QAM requires excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
     * Modern implementations rely heavily on digital signal processing (DSP)
     * Adaptive modulation systems dynamically adjust QAM order based on channel conditions
   
   **Security Implications**:
   - Higher-order QAM is more vulnerable to jamming and interference
   - Signal analysis can reveal usage patterns even without decoding content
   - Implementation complexity increases potential for side-channel leakage
   - Adaptive systems may leak information through their adaptation patterns

5. **Spread Spectrum Technologies**

   Spread spectrum techniques distribute a signal's energy across a wider frequency band than would otherwise be needed, offering improved security, resistance to interference, and frequency reuse. These technologies form the foundation of most modern wireless protocols.
   
   ```
   Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
   
   Data:       010011...
               │││││││
   Spreading   │││││││
   Code:       101101010101...
               │││││││
               ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓  (XOR)
               
   Spread      111110101010...
   Signal:     (Transmitted across wide bandwidth)
   
   Receiver:   111110101010... × 101101010101... = 010011...
               (Original data recovered through correlation)
   ```
   
   ```
   Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)

   Hopping sequence: 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 6, 3, 4, ...
   ```
   
   **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)**
   
   DSSS works by multiplying the data signal with a higher-rate pseudorandom sequence (spreading code or chip sequence) that spreads the signal energy across a wider bandwidth.
   
   - **Key characteristics**:
     * Each bit is represented by multiple chips (typically 11 in 802.11b WiFi)
     * Processing gain proportional to spreading ratio
     * Requires synchronization of spreading codes
     * Can operate below the noise floor
   
   - **Applications**:
     * IEEE 802.11b/g WiFi
     * GPS navigation signals
     * CDMA cellular communications
     * Military communications requiring LPI/LPD (Low Probability of Intercept/Detection)
   
   - **Security advantages**:
     * Inherent resistance to jamming
     * Lower power spectral density makes detection more difficult
     * Without knowledge of the spreading code, signal appears as noise
     * Can implement code-division multiple access (CDMA)
   
   **Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**
   
   FHSS rapidly switches the carrier frequency among many frequency channels, using a pseudorandom sequence known to both transmitter and receiver.
   
   - **Key characteristics**:
     * Typical hop rates from 10 to 1000 hops per second
     * Hopping sequences determine security and interference resistance
     * Requires time synchronization between devices
     * Easier to implement than DSSS but potentially less efficient
   
   - **Applications**:
     * Legacy Bluetooth (pre-v5.0)
     * Military tactical radios
     * Some industrial communication systems
     * Amateur radio
     * Specialized IoT networks
   
   - **Security considerations**:
     * Security depends on hopping pattern complexity
     * Vulnerable if hopping pattern is predictable
     * Resistant to narrowband jamming
     * Requires specialized equipment to intercept full transmission
   
   **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)**
   
   Though not traditionally considered spread spectrum, OFDM shares some characteristics and has largely replaced older spread spectrum techniques in modern wireless standards.
   
   ```

                 f₁   f₂   f₃
   
   Multiple orthogonal subcarriers each carrying part of the data
   ```
   
   - **Key characteristics**:
     * Data distributed across many closely-spaced orthogonal subcarriers
     * Each subcarrier uses conventional modulation (typically PSK or QAM)
     * Efficient FFT/IFFT processing for implementation
     * High spectral efficiency
     * Cyclic prefix to combat multipath effects
   
   - **Applications**:
     * Modern WiFi (802.11a/g/n/ac/ax)
     * 4G LTE and 5G cellular
     * Digital broadcasting (DVB-T/T2, DAB)
     * ADSL and cable broadband
   
   - **Hardware requirements**:
     * Significant digital signal processing capability
     * Precise timing synchronization
     * Good linearity in amplifiers to prevent intermodulation
     * Fast FFT processing capabilities
   
   **Security Implications**:
   - Spread spectrum technologies were originally developed for secure military communications
   - Commercial implementations typically focus on reliability rather than security
   - Specialized SDR equipment can still analyze and decode these signals
   - Hardware implementations of these complex systems often introduce security vulnerabilities

### Signal Characteristics and Measurements

Understanding how to measure and analyze RF signals is crucial for hardware hackers. These measurements reveal the presence, characteristics, and potential vulnerabilities of wireless systems.

1. **Power Measurements**

   In RF systems, power is rarely measured in watts directly. Instead, logarithmic scales are used to handle the wide dynamic range of signals.
   
   ```
   Power Level Comparison Chart
   
   dBm     Watts         Typical RF Applications
   +43     20W           Maximum legal EIRP for 2.4GHz ISM band in USA
   +36     4W            Typical cellular base station
   +30     1W            Maximum output for many handheld transmitters
   +20     100mW         Typical WiFi router output
   +15     32mW          Bluetooth Class 1 devices
   +4      2.5mW         Bluetooth Class 2 devices
   0       1mW           Reference level (0 dBm)
   -10     100μW         Typical ZigBee/Thread transmit power
   -30     1μW           RFID reader emissions at range
   -60     1nW           Weak signal at receiver detection threshold
   -90     1pW           Cellular reception threshold
   -100    0.1pW         GPS signal at Earth's surface
   -120    0.01pW        Approaching thermal noise floor
   ```
   
   - **dBm (Decibels relative to 1 milliwatt)**
     * Logarithmic scale: 0 dBm = 1 mW
     * Every +3 dBm ≈ doubling of power
     * Every -3 dBm ≈ halving of power
     * +10 dBm = 10 mW, +20 dBm = 100 mW, +30 dBm = 1 W
     * Critical for measuring signal strength across vast dynamic ranges
   
   - **Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)**
     * Combines transmitter power and antenna gain
     * EIRP = TX power + antenna gain - cable losses
     * Regulatory limits are typically specified in EIRP
     * Accounts for directional effects of antennas
     * Hardware hack implication: Increasing antenna gain effectively bypasses transmit power limitations

   - **Free Space Path Loss**
     * Signal power decreases with square of distance
     * FSPL (dB) = 20log₁₀(d) + 20log₁₀(f) + 32.44
       (where d = distance in km, f = frequency in MHz)
     * Higher frequencies attenuate more rapidly
     * Hardware hack implication: Knowing this formula helps calculate required equipment sensitivity
   
   - **Measurement Equipment**
     * **Power meters**: Direct measurement of RF power
       * Strengths: Accurate absolute power measurements
       * Limitations: No frequency information, relatively expensive
     * **Spectrum analyzers**: Frequency-domain power distribution
       * Strengths: Visualize signals across frequency range
       * Budget options: RTL-SDR (~$30), HackRF (~$300)
       * Professional gear: Tektronix, Rohde & Schwarz, Keysight ($5,000-$50,000)
     * **Field strength meters**: Portable measurement of ambient RF
       * Useful for site surveys and detecting leakage
   
   - **Regulatory Limits**
     | Region | Band | Max Power | Notes |
     |--------|------|-----------|-------|
     | USA (FCC) | 2.4GHz ISM | 36 dBm EIRP | Higher with directional antennas |
     | USA (FCC) | 5GHz U-NII | 30 dBm EIRP | Varies by sub-band |
     | Europe (ETSI) | 2.4GHz | 20 dBm EIRP | No antenna gain allowance |
     | Europe (ETSI) | 868MHz | 14 dBm EIRP | Duty cycle restrictions apply |
     | Japan (TELEC) | 2.4GHz | 13 dBm/MHz | Power spectral density limits |

   Understanding these limits is essential when analyzing devices for compliance or when modifying hardware, as exceeding limits can violate regulations.

2. **Signal Quality Indicators**

   Raw power measurements alone don't tell the full story. Several metrics evaluate signal quality and transmission fidelity:
   
   ```

   - **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**
     * Ratio of signal power to noise power, usually in dB
     * SNR = 10 log₁₀(Signal Power / Noise Power)
     * Critical threshold for digital modulations:
       * BPSK/QPSK: ~8-10 dB
       * 16-QAM: ~15 dB
       * 64-QAM: ~22 dB
       * 256-QAM: ~28 dB
     * Hardware hacking implication: Finding the SNR threshold reveals the point where transmission breaks down
   
   - **Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)**
     * Device-specific relative measurement of received power
     * No standardized scale across manufacturers
     * Often represented in dBm or arbitrary units
     * Used for rough proximity estimation
     * Hardware hacking uses: Signal strength mapping, rogue device detection, coverage analysis
   
   - **Bit Error Rate (BER)**
     * Proportion of bits received incorrectly
     * BER = (Errors / Total Bits) × 100%
     * Fundamental measure of digital link quality
     * Testing requires known bit patterns (preambles, sync words, test sequences)
     * Hardware hacking application: Determine maximum operational range or minimum required power
   
   - **Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)**
     * Measures deviation from ideal constellation points
     * Quantifies modulation accuracy
     * More sensitive than BER for analyzing transmission problems
     * EVM = √(Perror/Preference) × 100%
     * Hardware hacking implication: Reveals subtle implementation flaws in modulator/demodulator design

   - **Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR)**
     * Measures power leaking into neighboring channels
     * Indicates transmitter linearity and filtering quality
     * Poor ACPR suggests amplifier distortion or inadequate filtering
     * Hardware attack vector: Detecting signals from poorly designed systems outside their intended channels

3. **Bandwidth Considerations**

   Bandwidth is a fundamental constraint in wireless communications. Understanding bandwidth concepts helps analyze how efficiently systems use the limited radio spectrum.

             Bandwidth
             ◄───────────►
   ```
   
   - **Channel Bandwidth**
     * Allocated frequency space assigned for communication
     * Regulated and typically standardized within protocols
     * Common channel bandwidths:
       * Bluetooth: 1 MHz channels
       * WiFi: 20, 40, 80, 160 MHz channels
       * Cellular: Varies by technology (1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 MHz for LTE)
       * LoRa: 125, 250, 500 kHz channels
     * Hardware hacking implication: Understanding channel allocations helps identify and isolate target signals
   
   - **Occupied Bandwidth**
     * Actual frequency range containing 99% of signal power
     * Always less than or equal to channel bandwidth
     * Determined by modulation type and symbol rate
     * Hardware hacking implication: Empty space within channels may be exploitable for covert communication
   
   - **Nyquist Sampling Theorem**
     * To accurately represent a signal, sampling rate must be at least 2× the highest frequency component
     * Sets fundamental limit on data rate vs. bandwidth
     * Maximum theoretical bit rate = 2 × bandwidth × log₂(M) bits/second
       (where M = number of signal levels)
     * Hardware hacking application: Identifying whether a system operates near theoretical limits or has inefficiencies
   
   - **Symbol Rate vs. Bit Rate**
     * Symbol rate (baud rate) = rate of symbol changes per second
     * Bit rate = symbol rate × bits per symbol
     * Example: 1M symbols/sec using 64-QAM (6 bits/symbol) = 6 Mbps
     * Hardware hacking implication: Higher-order modulations are more vulnerable to noise and interference
   
   - **Spectral Efficiency**
     * Measures data throughput per unit of spectrum: bits/second/Hz
     * Key performance indicator for wireless protocols
     * Modern systems approach Shannon limit (theoretical maximum)
     * Comparison examples:
       * Bluetooth Classic GFSK: ~0.5-1 bps/Hz
       * WiFi 802.11n (64-QAM): ~4.5 bps/Hz
       * 802.11ac (256-QAM): ~6 bps/Hz
       * 5G NR (1024-QAM): ~7.5 bps/Hz
     * Hardware hacking consideration: Systems operating near theoretical limits have less tolerance for interference
