# Hardware Communication Protocols

Understanding communication protocols is crucial for hardware hackers, as these protocols govern how components within a device communicate. This knowledge allows you to intercept, analyze, and manipulate data flows between hardware components.

## Introduction to Hardware Protocols

Hardware protocols define rules for data exchange between electronic components. By understanding these protocols, hackers can:

1. Intercept sensitive information
2. Inject malicious commands
3. Reverse engineer functionality
4. Extract firmware and secrets
5. Identify security vulnerabilities
6. Develop hardware-based attacks

This section covers the most common protocols you'll encounter during hardware security assessment.
