- Learning specific techniques or tools
- Getting feedback on personal projects
- Meeting potential collaborators with complementary skills
- Identifying resources for continued learning

### During the Event

Active engagement maximizes value during events:

**Balance Sessions and Conversations** recognizing that hallway discussions often provide as much value as formal presentations. Many experienced attendees select fewer formal sessions, leaving time for spontaneous discussions and hands-on activities.

**Document Experiences** through notes, photographs, and collected materials. Cognitive overload during intensive events makes later recall challenging without documentation. Consider creating a personal wiki or structured notes system for organizing information acquired across multiple events.

**Engage Appropriately** with presenters and other participants. When asking questions during presentations, focus on clarifications or insights relevant to the broader audience. Save detailed personal questions for after sessions when one-on-one conversations become possible.

**Participate in Challenges** even if you doubt your skills. Many hardware hacking competitions include deliberately accessible challenges alongside advanced ones, and the learning value often exceeds the competitive aspect.

### After the Event

Post-event activities transform temporary experiences into lasting value:

**Review and Organize Materials** collected during the event, including presentation slides, handouts, and personal notes. This review often reveals connections between different sessions that weren't apparent during the event itself.

**Implement Learned Techniques** through practical projects that apply new knowledge. Immediate application significantly improves retention and understanding compared to passive review.

**Maintain Connections** established during the event through appropriate follow-up. Professional networking platforms, specialized Discord servers, or email exchanges can transform brief in-person introductions into lasting professional relationships.

**Share Insights** with your broader community through blog posts, local meetup presentations, or social media summaries. This sharing solidifies your understanding while contributing to the community knowledge base.

## Virtual and Hybrid Events

The hardware hacking community has embraced virtual and hybrid events, particularly following global disruptions that limited in-person gatherings. These formats offer different benefits and challenges compared to traditional conferences.

### Virtual Event Formats
