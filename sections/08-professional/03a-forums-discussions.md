**When Asking Questions:**
- Provide specific details about hardware (make, model, version)
- Include clear photographs of relevant components or connections
- Describe steps already taken and results observed
- Format code or command output for readability
- State your actual goal, not just the immediate technical question

**When Answering Questions:**
- Provide context and explanation, not just solutions
- Include references to sources where appropriate
- Acknowledge alternative approaches
- Use clear formatting with code blocks, lists, and paragraphs
- Consider including diagrams for complex explanations

This approach not only helps address immediate questions but builds a valuable knowledge base for future reference.

### Building Community Reputation
