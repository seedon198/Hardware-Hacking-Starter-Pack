1. **Signal Interception Tools**

   Specialized hardware is required to effectively monitor Bluetooth traffic. Each tool offers different capabilities, costs, and learning curves:

   - **Ubertooth One**
     * **Hardware Architecture**: An open-source platform based on the TI CC2400 radio and ARM Cortex-M3 processor
     * **Technical Capabilities**:
       * Capturing Basic Rate/EDR non-encrypted packets (with limitations)
       * Full BLE packet monitoring
       * Raw signal monitoring across 2.4GHz spectrum
       * LAP (Lower Address Part) sniffing for BR/EDR devices
       * RSSI monitoring and device proximity detection
       * Limited hopping sequence following
     
     * **Practical Usage Example**: Capturing BLE advertisements

     ```python
     # Example using the pyubertooth library
     from pyubertooth.ubertooth import Ubertooth
     import time
     
     def capture_ble_advertisements(duration=60):
         # Initialize Ubertooth device
         ut = Ubertooth()
         ut.device.set_jam_mode(False)
         ut.device.set_channel(37)  # BLE advertising channel
         
         # Set up callbacks
         def callback(pkt):
             if pkt.get("BLE_ADV_IND"):
                 adv = pkt.get("BLE_ADV_IND")
                 addr = adv.get("AdvA", "Unknown")
                 data = adv.get("AdvData", b'').hex()
                 print(f"BLE Advertisement - Address: {addr}, Data: {data}")
         
         # Start sniffing
         ut.start_survey(callback=callback)
         time.sleep(duration)  # Run for specified duration
         ut.stop_survey()
         ut.close()
