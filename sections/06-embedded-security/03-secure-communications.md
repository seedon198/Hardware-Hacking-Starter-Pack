# Secure Communications for Embedded Devices

Embedded devices rarely operate in isolation. Most connect to sensors, actuators, other devices, or remote services—creating numerous attack vectors through these communication channels. Securing these connections is essential to maintain overall system security, even when secure boot and memory protection are properly implemented.

## Communication Security Challenges

Embedded systems face unique communication security challenges:

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Resource constraints | Limited processing power, memory, and energy for cryptographic operations |
| Diverse protocols | Multiple communication technologies with varying security capabilities |
| Long deployment lifecycles | Need for security that remains effective for 10+ years |
| Legacy compatibility | Requirements to interface with older systems lacking modern security |
| Physical exposure | Communication channels potentially accessible to physical probing |

These challenges often lead to simplified or compromised security implementations. Addressing them requires understanding both security requirements and implementation constraints.

## Security Requirements for Communication

Secure communications typically address several core requirements:

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality prevents unauthorized access to transmitted information. For embedded systems, this might protect:

- User personal data
- Authentication credentials
- Configuration information
- Firmware updates
- Sensor readings with privacy implications

Implementing confidentiality typically involves encryption—transforming data into a form only accessible to authorized recipients with the proper key.

### Integrity

Integrity ensures data hasn't been modified during transmission, whether accidentally or maliciously. This protects against:

- Command injection attacks
- Configuration tampering
- Sensor data manipulation
- Firmware update corruption

Integrity mechanisms typically add authentication codes or digital signatures that verify the data's integrity.

### Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of communication endpoints, ensuring messages come from legitimate sources. This prevents:

- Device impersonation
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Unauthorized command injection
- Rogue device connections

Authentication may occur at the device level (verifying device identity) or message level (verifying each message's origin).

### Freshness

Freshness protects against replay attacks where valid but old messages are retransmitted. Protection mechanisms include:

- Timestamps with synchronized clocks
- Sequence numbers
- Challenge-response protocols
- Session-specific nonces

Without freshness protection, attackers might replay valid commands or responses to manipulate system behavior.

## Security at Different Communication Layers

Communication security can be implemented at various protocol stack layers, each with different characteristics:

| Layer | Security Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| Physical | Signal characteristics, out-of-band channels | Resistant to software attacks | Limited capabilities, often proprietary |
| Link | Point-to-point encryption, MAC-level authentication | Efficient, hardware acceleration | Secures single links only |
| Network | End-to-end routing security, network-level authentication | Comprehensive path protection | Protocol overhead, implementation complexity |
| Transport | Session encryption, connection authentication | Application-independent | Not suitable for all traffic types |
| Application | Protocol-specific security, data-focused protection | Tailored to application needs | Requires per-application implementation |

Most robust systems implement security at multiple layers, creating defense in depth against communication attacks.

## Cryptographic Building Blocks

Several cryptographic primitives form the foundation of secure communications:

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption:

| Algorithm | Key Size | Block Size | Notes for Embedded Use |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------------|
| AES | 128/192/256 bits | 128 bits | Hardware acceleration common, standard choice |
| ChaCha20 | 256 bits | Stream cipher | Efficient in software, good for constrained devices |
| PRESENT | 80/128 bits | 64 bits | Designed for resource-constrained hardware |
| SIMON/SPECK | Various | Various | Designed for small footprint in hardware/software |

Selecting an appropriate algorithm requires balancing security strength, resource requirements, and compatibility with other systems.

### Message Authentication

Message authentication codes (MACs) verify data integrity and authenticity:

| Algorithm | Output Size | Notes for Embedded Use |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| HMAC-SHA256 | 256 bits (adjustable) | Standard choice, can leverage SHA hardware |
| CMAC-AES | 128 bits | Uses AES primitives, good with AES hardware |
| Poly1305 | 128 bits | Often paired with ChaCha20, efficient in software |

MACs provide integrity and authentication but require sharing a secret key between communicating parties.

### Public Key Cryptography

Public key cryptography enables secure communication without pre-shared secrets:

| Algorithm | Key Size | Notes for Embedded Use |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| RSA | 2048+ bits | High resource requirements, widely supported |
| ECDSA | 256+ bits | Much more efficient than RSA, growing adoption |
| Ed25519 | 256 bits | Modern, efficient signature scheme |
| ECDH | 256+ bits | Efficient key agreement protocol |

Public key operations are significantly more resource-intensive than symmetric algorithms, making their use more challenging in constrained environments.

### Authenticated Encryption

Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) simultaneously provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity:

| Algorithm | Based On | Notes for Embedded Use |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| AES-GCM | AES | Popular, hardware acceleration common |
| ChaCha20-Poly1305 | ChaCha20+Poly1305 | Efficient software implementation |
| AES-CCM | AES | Common in constrained wireless applications |

AEAD algorithms simplify security by combining multiple protections into a single operation.

## Security Protocols for Embedded Systems

Several security protocols are commonly used in embedded systems:

### TLS/DTLS

Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its datagram variant (DTLS) provide encrypted, authenticated communications:

**Key Features:**
- Certificate-based authentication
- Perfect forward secrecy (with ephemeral key exchange)
- Strong cipher support
- Standardized and widely implemented

**Embedded Considerations:**
- Resource-intensive handshake process
- Significant code size for full implementation
- Certificate management challenges
- Lightweight implementations available (e.g., mbed TLS, wolfSSL)

TLS typically secures HTTP (HTTPS), MQTT, and other TCP-based protocols, while DTLS secures UDP communications like CoAP.

### SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) provides secure remote access and tunnel capabilities:

**Key Features:**
- Strong authentication options
- Secure remote command execution
- Port forwarding capabilities
- File transfer protocols

**Embedded Considerations:**
- Primarily for maintenance and administration
- Smaller implementations available (e.g., Dropbear, wolfSSH)
- Can secure machine-to-machine communications
- Authentication requires careful key management

### IPsec

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) secures communications at the IP layer:

**Key Features:**
- Transport and tunnel modes
- Support for various authentication mechanisms
- Operates below transport layer (TCP/UDP)
- Can secure entire network connections

**Embedded Considerations:**
- Complex implementation and configuration
- Significant overhead for small packets
- Typically used in router/gateway devices
- Less common in highly constrained devices

### Lightweight Protocols

Several protocols target resource-constrained environments:

| Protocol | Characteristics | Typical Applications |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| OSCORE | End-to-end security for CoAP | IoT, sensor networks |
| EDHOC | Lightweight authenticated key exchange | IoT device provisioning |
| COSE | Lightweight alternative to JOSE/JWT | IoT authentication, authorization |
| IEEE 802.15.4 Security | Link-layer security | Wireless sensor networks |

These protocols implement security with minimal overhead, making them suitable for severely constrained devices.

## Implementation Strategies

Implementing secure communications for embedded systems requires careful consideration of several factors:

### Protocol Selection

Choose protocols based on:

1. **Security requirements** - What threats must be mitigated?
2. **Resource constraints** - Processing power, memory, energy availability
3. **Compatibility requirements** - What must the device communicate with?
4. **Communication patterns** - Request-response, streaming, publish-subscribe?

For constrained devices, consider:

| Resource Profile | Recommended Approach |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Severely constrained | Lightweight protocols, link-layer security |
| Moderately constrained | TLS/DTLS with optimized cipher choices |
| Resource-rich embedded | Standard TLS, possibly with additional protocols |

### Efficient Implementation

Several strategies improve security implementation efficiency:

1. **Hardware acceleration** - Use cryptographic hardware when available
2. **Optimized libraries** - Choose libraries designed for embedded use
3. **Protocol parameter tuning** - Adjust buffer sizes, timeouts for the environment
4. **Persistent connections** - Amortize handshake costs over multiple transactions

Example code for TLS with hardware acceleration (using ESP32):

```c
// Configure hardware acceleration
esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {
    .cacert_buf = ca_cert,
    .cacert_bytes = ca_cert_len,
    .use_secure_element = true,  // Use hardware security module if available
    .crt_bundle_attach = esp_crt_bundle_attach
};

// Create TLS connection with hardware acceleration
esp_tls_t *tls = esp_tls_conn_http_new(server_url, &cfg);
if (tls == NULL) {
    // Handle connection error
    return ESP_FAIL;
}

// Send/receive data over secure connection
esp_tls_conn_write(tls, request, request_len);
esp_tls_conn_read(tls, response, response_len);

// Clean up
esp_tls_conn_destroy(tls);
```

### Key Management

Effective key management is crucial for communication security:

| Key Type | Management Considerations |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Factory keys | Unique per device, securely provisioned, limited purposes |
| Session keys | Ephemeral, regularly rotated, generated via secure key exchange |
| Group keys | Managed for group communication, need secure update mechanism |
| Root certificates | Validate trust anchors, include revocation capability |

Best practices include:

1. **Key isolation** - Store keys in secure elements or protected memory
2. **Key rotation** - Change keys regularly to limit compromise impact
3. **Key hierarchy** - Use different keys for different purposes
4. **Key revocation** - Mechanism to invalidate compromised keys

### Certificate Management

For certificate-based protocols (TLS, etc.), effective management includes:

1. **Trust anchor management** - Securely store root certificates
2. **Certificate validation** - Verify certificate chains and revocation status
3. **Certificate provisioning** - Securely deploy device certificates
4. **Certificate renewal** - Handle expiration gracefully

For constrained devices, simplified approaches include:

- Pre-shared keys instead of full certificates
- Lightweight certificate formats (e.g., X.509 subset)
- Network-specific trust models reducing chain validation needs

## Security Analysis of Communication Channels

When analyzing embedded device communications, consider these key areas:

### Protocol Analysis

Examine protocol security properties:

1. **Protocol specification review** - Assess designed security mechanisms
2. **Implementation verification** - Ensure correct implementation of specifications
3. **Configuration analysis** - Check for insecure parameter choices
4. **Update mechanisms** - Verify securable update of protocols and parameters

### Traffic Analysis

Analyze actual communication traffic:

1. **Passive monitoring** - Capture and examine communication patterns
2. **Encryption verification** - Confirm plaintext isn't transmitted
3. **Protocol conformance** - Verify communications follow expected patterns
4. **Information leakage** - Check for metadata exposing sensitive information

Tools for traffic analysis include:

- Wireshark with protocol dissectors
- Logic analyzers for physical-layer analysis
- Specialized IoT protocol analyzers
- Custom tools for proprietary protocols

### Vulnerability Testing

Test for specific communication vulnerabilities:

| Test Type | Purpose | Common Tools |
|-----------|---------|--------------|

| Protocol | Purpose | Security Implementation |
|----------|---------|-------------------------|
| Modbus TCP | Control communication | TLS tunnel, IP restrictions |
| OPC UA | Data acquisition | OPC UA Security, certificate-based |
| MQTT | Telemetry reporting | Username/password, TLS transport |
| HTTPS | Configuration interface | TLS, token-based authentication |

Security analysis identified:
- Modbus lacking message authentication within TLS tunnel
- Expired certificates in OPC UA implementation
- Weak default credentials for MQTT broker
- Insufficient access controls in configuration API

## Advanced Topics

### Quantum Resistance

Quantum computing threatens conventional cryptography, particularly public key algorithms. Post-quantum cryptographic approaches include:

| Approach | Characteristics | Embedded Considerations |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Lattice-based | Based on hard lattice problems | Relatively efficient, promising for embedded |
| Hash-based | Relies on cryptographic hash properties | Suitable for code signing, larger signatures |
| Isogeny-based | Based on elliptic curve isogenies | Compact keys, computationally intensive |
| Code-based | Error-correcting code problems | Larger keys, but well-studied |

As quantum computers advance, transitioning to resistant algorithms becomes increasingly important for long-lived embedded systems.

### Side-Channel Protection

Communication implementations may leak information through side channels:

| Side Channel | Description | Countermeasure |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Timing | Variations in processing time | Constant-time implementations |
| Power | Power consumption patterns | Power smoothing, noise generation |
| Electromagnetic | EM emissions during operations | Shielding, balanced operations |
| Acoustic | Sound emissions from components | Physical isolation, dampening |

Sensitive embedded systems should implement appropriate countermeasures based on threat models and physical access risks.

### Secure Aggregation and Multiparty Communication

Many IoT scenarios involve multiple devices sharing or aggregating data:

| Approach | Application | Security Properties |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Secure aggregation | Sensor networks | Aggregate data without exposing individual values |
| Group key management | Device fleets | Secure communication within dynamic groups |
| Threshold cryptography | Distributed control | Require multiple parties for sensitive operations |

These approaches enable secure collaboration while maintaining individual device security.

## Conclusion

Communication security represents a critical aspect of embedded system security. By implementing appropriate cryptographic primitives, security protocols, and key management practices, embedded devices can communicate securely despite their inherent constraints.

When designing embedded communications, remember that security must be:

1. **Proportional** to the sensitivity of the data and the threat environment
2. **Sustainable** within the device's resource constraints
3. **Maintainable** throughout the device's operational lifetime
4. **Comprehensive** across all communication channels

The next section explores [Physical Security Mechanisms](./09d-physical-security.md), which complement communication security by protecting against threats requiring physical access to the device.
