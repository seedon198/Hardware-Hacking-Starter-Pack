UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) stands as the gateway to embedded systems—a ubiquitous protocol that provides direct insight into a device's operation. In the hardware hacking landscape, UART interfaces often represent the path of least resistance for initial exploration, frequently exposing debug consoles, boot logs, and configuration interfaces that were never intended for end-user access. This simple serial communication method has remained fundamentally unchanged for decades, offering a reliable entry point for security researchers despite the increasing complexity of modern electronics.

## UART Fundamentals

### Basics of UART

At its core, UART implements a straightforward communication method distinguished by several key characteristics that make it both versatile and accessible for hardware hackers.

**Asynchronous communication** forms the foundation of UART's operation—unlike synchronous protocols, UART doesn't rely on a shared clock signal between devices. Instead, both sender and receiver must agree on timing parameters in advance (the baud rate), allowing them to independently sample the signal at appropriate intervals. This asynchronous nature simplifies wiring but requires precise timing agreement between devices.

The **full-duplex capability** of UART enables simultaneous bidirectional communication, with separate transmit (TX) and receive (RX) lines allowing devices to send and receive data concurrently. This feature is particularly valuable for interactive debugging sessions or when continuous monitoring of a data stream is required while still being able to send commands.

The **minimal pin requirement**—typically just TX, RX, and a common ground—makes UART interfaces easy to identify and access on crowded circuit boards. This simplicity stands in stark contrast to more complex protocols that may require four or more connections, making UART an ideal starting point when investigating unknown hardware.

```

The **communication speed** or baud rate must match between devices for successful communication. Common rates include 9600, 115200, 57600, and 38400 bits per second, with 115200 being particularly prevalent in modern embedded systems. When the baud rate is unknown, systematic testing of common values or signal analysis with an oscilloscope becomes necessary.

The **data format** consists of several components that form each UART transmission:
- A start bit (always low/0) that signals the beginning of a new byte
- Data bits (typically 8) containing the actual information
- An optional parity bit for basic error detection
- One or two stop bits (always high/1) that signal the end of the byte

This framing structure ensures that receivers can properly synchronize and extract data from the continuous stream of bits.

### UART vs RS-232

A common source of confusion for hardware hackers is the relationship between UART and RS-232. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they represent different aspects of serial communication:

    <th>UART</th>
    <th>RS-232</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Definition</td>
    <td>Communication protocol and hardware interface</td>
    <td>Electrical specification/standard</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Voltage Levels</td>
    <td>Logic levels (typically 3.3V or 5V)</td>
    <td>Higher voltage (±5V to ±15V)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Signal Interpretation</td>
    <td>High = 1, Low = 0</td>
    <td>Negative = 1, Positive = 0 (inverted logic)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Common Use</td>
    <td>Internal communication between ICs</td>
    <td>External connections between devices (legacy)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hardware Example</td>
    <td>Microcontroller UART pins</td>
    <td>DB-9 or DB-25 serial ports on older computers</td>
  </tr>
</table>

While UART defines the protocol and basic hardware interface using standard logic levels (typically 3.3V or 5V), RS-232 specifies an electrical standard with higher voltages (±5V to ±15V) and inverted logic (negative voltage for 1, positive for 0). Many devices marketed as having "serial ports" actually implement the RS-232 electrical standard while using the UART protocol for data framing and timing.

When connecting modern logic-level UART to RS-232 equipment, level converters such as the MAX232 chip translate between these different electrical standards without altering the underlying protocol. Understanding this distinction helps hardware hackers select appropriate equipment and make proper connections when interfacing with different types of serial interfaces.

```

Locating UART interfaces on unfamiliar hardware represents the first step in accessing the valuable information they often contain. Since UART provides such a high-value target for hardware hackers, manufacturers sometimes attempt to obscure these interfaces, though economic and production realities typically prevent them from being completely hidden.

### Visual Identification

The hunt for UART connections begins with visual inspection of the printed circuit board, seeking several telltale indicators that distinguish these interfaces from other components.

**Labeled pins** offer the most straightforward identification method. Manufacturers frequently mark UART connections with designations such as TX/RX, UART, CONSOLE, or DEBUG directly on the PCB silkscreen. In production devices intended for developers or manufacturers' internal testing, these labels often remain visible even in consumer products. Carefully examine the board under good lighting and magnification to locate these markings, which may be abbreviated or printed in small text.

**Header pin arrangements** provide another reliable indicator. UART connections typically appear as a row of 3-4 pins (TX, RX, GND, and sometimes VCC) that may be populated with a pin header or left as empty through-holes or pads. These are frequently positioned near the edge of the board for easy access during development and manufacturing testing. The standard 0.1" (2.54mm) pin spacing is common, though more compact devices might use smaller pitch connectors.

**Unpopulated header areas** on the PCB often indicate debugging interfaces that weren't populated in the final product to reduce costs. Look for rectangular groups of solder pads or plated through-holes that could accommodate header pins. Even without component silkscreen labels, these areas often have PCB trace patterns consistent with serial communication lines. Manufacturers sometimes remove designations from the silkscreen in consumer versions but leave the electrical connections intact.

**Test points** represent a more subtle form of access, designed to be less obvious than full headers. These appear as small circular pads, sometimes with a via in the center, and may be labeled with tiny text or reference designations like TP1, TP2, etc. They're designed for temporary connections during manufacturing or repair and provide an ideal connection point for probing. Groups of test points arranged in a line often indicate debugging interfaces.

### Pin Discovery Techniques

When visual identification doesn't yield clear results, more active discovery techniques become necessary to locate and confirm UART pins.

**Visual trace following** involves carefully tracking the PCB traces from suspected UART pins to identify their connection to the main processor or microcontroller. This works best on simpler boards with fewer layers or when traces are visible on the surface. Look for traces that lead to pins on the main IC that are likely to be UART functions based on their position or package pinout if known. Digital microscopes or magnifying glasses greatly assist this process, allowing you to follow fine traces even on densely packed boards.

**Multimeter continuity testing** provides an electrical verification method when visual tracing is limited by board complexity. If you can identify the main processor and have access to its datasheet, locate the pins designated for UART functionality. Then use a multimeter in continuity mode to test for electrical connections between those processor pins and suspected UART header pins or test points. This technique works even when traces run through internal PCB layers that aren't visually accessible.

**Logic analysis with active probing** becomes necessary when other methods prove insufficient. By connecting a logic analyzer or oscilloscope to suspected pins while the device boots or operates, you can observe signal characteristics. UART TX pins will show digital transitions (typically idle high with data transitions during boot) even without an active connection. Multiple-pin scanning can be performed systematically to identify which pins carry serial data patterns characteristic of UART communication.

Once UART pins have been identified, the next step involves establishing a connection to capture and interact with the data passing through this interface. The proper equipment and connection technique determine whether your efforts yield valuable insights or remain frustratingly unproductive.

### Required Equipment

Successful UART interfacing requires a specific set of tools, with modern USB-based adapters replacing the bulky serial ports of earlier computing eras.

**USB-to-UART adapters** serve as the bridge between your computer and the target device's serial interface. Popular chipsets include the FT232 from FTDI, CP2102 from Silicon Labs, and CH340G, each with various development boards and adapter cables built around them. Most adapters support multiple voltage levels (commonly 3.3V and 5V) through jumper selection. For hardware hacking purposes, adapters with exposed pins or breakout headers provide the flexibility needed for various connection scenarios.

**Jumper wires** with appropriate terminations facilitate physical connections to the target hardware. A variety of types proves useful: breadboard jumper wires, female-to-female dupont wires for header pins, and test hooks or micro grabber probes for connecting to small test points. Having an assortment of wire types prepares you for different connection challenges, from standard headers to tiny exposed pads.

**Logic level converters** become essential when voltage mismatches exist between your adapter and the target device. While many modern devices operate at 3.3V, some use 1.8V or other voltages. Connecting a 5V adapter directly to a 3.3V or lower device risks damaging the target. Bidirectional level shifters translate between different logic levels, protecting both your equipment and the target device from electrical damage.

**Terminal software** on your computer provides the interface for viewing and interacting with UART data. Options range from simple command-line utilities like `screen` or `minicom` on Linux/macOS to graphical applications like PuTTY or TeraTerm on Windows. More advanced serial terminal applications like CoolTerm or the Arduino Serial Monitor offer additional features like data logging and timing analysis. For hardware security work, terminals with hexadecimal display capabilities prove particularly valuable when analyzing binary data streams.

### Connection Process

Establishing a proper UART connection follows a methodical process that minimizes the risk of electrical damage while maximizing the chances of successful communication.

**Ground connection comes first**—always. Before connecting any signal lines, establish a common ground reference between your adapter and the target device. This shared ground prevents potential differences that could damage sensitive components and ensures proper signal interpretation. The ground pin can typically be identified through continuity testing with known ground points on the board (such as metal shields, mounting holes, or the negative side of electrolytic capacitors).

**Identifying TX and RX pins** requires understanding the naming convention: pins are labeled from the perspective of the device they're on. This creates the counterintuitive requirement that you connect the target device's TX pin to your adapter's RX pin, and vice versa. This crossover connection ensures that data output from one device reaches the input of the other. If pin functions aren't labeled, a logic analyzer or oscilloscope can help—the TX line from the target will show activity during boot without any connection, while RX will remain idle until you transmit data.

**Voltage level determination** protects against electrical damage. Use a multimeter to measure the voltage on the target's TX pin relative to ground during operation. Most devices use 3.3V or 5V logic, but some newer or low-power designs operate at 1.8V or even lower voltages. Ensure your UART adapter is set to the appropriate voltage level, or use a level shifter if necessary. Connecting a 3.3V device to a 5V adapter without proper level shifting can permanently damage the target hardware.

**Wire connections** should follow the crossover pattern: GND to GND, Device TX to Adapter RX, and Device RX to Adapter TX. Make secure mechanical connections—loose wires can cause intermittent communication failures that are difficult to troubleshoot. For temporary connections to test points, careful hand-holding of probes or temporary soldering may be necessary. Adding small value resistors (330Ω-1kΩ) in series with the TX/RX lines provides extra protection during initial testing.

**Terminal software configuration** requires setting the correct parameters. While data bits (8), parity (none), and stop bits (1) are standardized in most modern devices, the baud rate varies significantly. Try common rates like 115200, 9600, 57600, and 38400 baud if the rate is unknown. Modern terminal software allows you to quickly switch between baud rates until readable text appears. Select the correct serial port in your software, which may require identifying the new USB device that appears when you connect your adapter.

```

After establishing a physical connection to a UART interface, several technical challenges must be overcome to extract meaningful data and interact with the target system. These include determining the correct communication parameters and navigating the interface to discover valuable information.

### Finding the Correct Baud Rate

The most common obstacle when connecting to an unknown UART interface is determining the appropriate baud rate. Unlike some protocols with clock signals that self-synchronize, UART requires both sides to agree on the transmission speed beforehand. When documentation isn't available, several approaches can yield this critical parameter:

**Trial and error with common rates** offers the simplest approach. Most embedded systems use standardized speeds, with 115200, 9600, 57600, and 38400 bits per second being the most prevalent. Modern terminal software allows quick switching between these values while observing the output. When the correct rate is selected, readable ASCII text appears instead of garbled characters. Consumer devices often use 115200 bps for development consoles, while 9600 bps remains common in simpler systems or those prioritizing reliability over speed.

**Automated tools** can systematically detect the correct baud rate by analyzing signal patterns. Utilities like `baudrate.py` from the pyserial package capture UART data and test various rates to find the one producing valid ASCII output. These tools are particularly valuable when dealing with uncommon baud rates or when the target produces limited output that might be missed during manual switching.

**Oscilloscope measurement** provides a direct, hardware-based approach to baud rate detection. By capturing the UART signal during transmission and measuring the time duration of the shortest pulse (representing a single bit), you can calculate the baud rate using the formula: baud rate = 1/(bit time in seconds). For example, if the shortest pulse width is 8.68 microseconds, the baud rate would be approximately 115,207 bps, indicating a standard 115200 bps rate with slight timing variation.

**Logic analyzer auto-detection** leverages specialized hardware to automatically detect and decode UART signals. Modern logic analyzers include built-in protocol analyzers that can identify UART traffic parameters including baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits by sampling the signal and analyzing its timing characteristics. These tools greatly accelerate the process, especially when working with complex systems or non-standard configurations.

### Terminal Software Configuration

Successful UART communication requires correct configuration of several parameters beyond just the baud rate:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Common Setting</th>
    <th>Alternatives</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data Bits</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>7, 5, 6</td>
    <td>The vast majority of modern systems use 8 data bits</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Parity</td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>Even, Odd</td>
    <td>Parity is rarely used in modern embedded systems</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stop Bits</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Two stop bits were more common in older/slower systems</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Flow Control</td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>Hardware, Software</td>
    <td>Debug interfaces typically don't implement flow control</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Line Ending</td>
    <td>CR+LF</td>
    <td>LF only, CR only</td>
    <td>Important when sending commands to the target</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The "8N1" configuration (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) represents the de facto standard for modern embedded systems and should be your starting point when the exact parameters are unknown. While terminal emulation software typically handles control character interpretation, be aware that different operating systems use different line ending conventions—Linux/Unix systems typically use LF (Line Feed, '\n'), while Windows uses CR+LF (Carriage Return + Line Feed, '\r\n'). Some embedded command interfaces may be particular about which style they accept for proper command parsing.

### Common UART Security Issues

UART interfaces frequently expose significant security vulnerabilities that would otherwise remain inaccessible through standard user interfaces. These represent high-value targets for hardware security researchers:

```

**Accessible debug interfaces** represent one of the most significant security issues associated with UART. Many devices ship with developer or manufacturing debug ports enabled, providing unauthenticated root shells or bootloader access. These interfaces are intended for development or factory testing but often remain active in production units. Unlike network services that might require authentication, these hardware interfaces frequently operate under the assumption that physical access already implies authorized use. Systems running embedded Linux commonly expose root shells without password protection, while custom firmware might present proprietary command interfaces with similar privileges.

**Exposed firmware update mechanisms** accessible through UART can enable complete device compromise. Bootloaders like U-Boot, BusyBox, or proprietary alternatives often include commands for updating device firmware, loading alternate boot images, or modifying boot parameters. These mechanisms, designed for recovery or manufacturing, frequently lack cryptographic verification of firmware images or have bypass options intended for development. Hardware hackers can exploit these interfaces to load modified firmware, effectively gaining complete control of the target device without requiring sophisticated attacks.

**Unencrypted sensitive data** frequently appears in UART communications, as developers often prioritize debugging convenience over security. Boot logs may contain hardcoded credentials, API keys, encryption keys, or other secrets that were never intended to be exposed. Configuration data including network settings, user accounts, or service credentials might be displayed during initialization or accessible through debug commands. Even when an interactive shell isn't available, passive monitoring during boot often reveals sensitive information that can facilitate further attacks through other vectors.

**Command injection vulnerabilities** are common in UART command processors, which often lack the input validation rigor applied to network-facing interfaces. Debug commands may process user input with insufficient sanitization, allowing injection of additional commands or parameter manipulation. These flaws are particularly common in custom firmware with proprietary command interfaces developed without security review. Testing various special characters (semicolons, pipes, quotation marks, etc.) within command parameters can reveal these vulnerabilities, potentially allowing privilege escalation or access to restricted functionality.

**Information leakage through boot logs** provides attackers with valuable system details even when direct exploitation isn't immediately possible. Boot messages typically reveal hardware configurations, kernel versions, enabled services, file system layouts, and memory maps. This information helps identify the specific software versions running on the device, enabling targeted research for known vulnerabilities. Memory addresses and layout information can assist in developing more advanced attacks like return-oriented programming or buffer overflows that might otherwise require significant trial and error.

## UART Hacking Techniques

UART interfaces serve as valuable entry points for hardware security assessment, offering several distinct attack vectors that can be leveraged to gain deeper access to target systems. These techniques range from passive observation to active interaction and modification.

### Boot Process Interception

The boot phase represents a particularly vulnerable period in a device's operation, with UART access enabling several powerful interception techniques:

**Boot message analysis** yields a wealth of information without requiring any interaction with the target. As devices initialize, they typically output detailed diagnostic information through the UART interface—processor type, RAM size, peripheral detection, kernel loading addresses, file system mounting, and service initialization. This passive reconnaissance provides a map of the system's architecture and potential attack surfaces. Pay particular attention to error messages, which often reveal more information than successful operations, such as attempted file accesses or configuration issues that expose path information.

**Bootloader interruption** grants access to powerful low-level controls. Many devices use bootloaders (like U-Boot, RedBoot, or proprietary equivalents) that pause during initialization, waiting for user input to interrupt the normal boot sequence. This interruption window is often indicated by messages like "Press any key to stop autoboot" or similar prompts. The timing may be very brief—sometimes only a few seconds—requiring careful observation and quick action. Once interrupted, bootloaders typically provide command interfaces with capabilities for viewing or modifying memory, loading alternate boot images, or changing boot parameters.

**Command injection during boot** alters the device's startup behavior. Many bootloaders allow modification of kernel command line parameters or environment variables that control the boot process. Common targets include:
- Adding `init=/bin/sh` to boot directly to a shell instead of the normal initialization process
- Modifying root file system location (`root=` parameter)
- Disabling security features with parameters like `selinux=0` or `lockdown=none`
- Adding `single` or `1` to boot into single-user/maintenance mode
These modifications can bypass security mechanisms that would otherwise be active during normal operation.

### Debug Console Access

Many devices expose command interfaces through UART that provide significant control and information disclosure:

**Default credential testing** remains effective against many embedded systems. When authentication is present, manufacturers often use predictable credentials that remain unchanged in production devices. Common username/password combinations include:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Username</th>
    <th>Password</th>
    <th>Common In</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>root</td>
    <td>root</td>
    <td>Linux-based devices, consumer routers</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>admin</td>
    <td>admin</td>
    <td>Network equipment, cameras</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>user</td>
    <td>user</td>
    <td>Consumer electronics</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>debug</td>
    <td>debug</td>
    <td>Development interfaces</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>service</td>
    <td>service</td>
    <td>Maintenance interfaces</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[blank]</td>
    <td>[blank]</td>
    <td>Many embedded systems</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Searching for default credentials specific to the device manufacturer or platforms can yield additional possibilities, as companies often reuse the same credentials across product lines.

**Authentication bypass techniques** circumvent security controls on debug interfaces. Even when credential-based authentication exists, it may be vulnerable to various bypasses:
- Character overflow attacks where sending excessive input crashes the authentication module
- Timing attacks that interrupt the authentication process at specific moments
- Special character sequences that trigger bugs in the parser
- Debug commands that might be accessible pre-authentication
Some interfaces implement different levels of authentication for different command sets, with certain diagnostic commands available without full authentication.

**Command injection testing** against UART interfaces often reveals vulnerabilities not present in more hardened interfaces. Command interpreters designed for debugging may parse input differently than production interfaces, with less stringent validation. Test for injection vulnerabilities by including special characters in parameters (`& ; | > < $ ( ) { } [ ] ' " \`) and observing how the system responds. Successful injections might execute additional commands, reveal file contents, or modify system behavior in unexpected ways.

### Hardware Modification

Advanced techniques involve more sophisticated interaction with UART interfaces to manipulate device behavior:

**UART signal injection** introduces forged data into the communication stream. By connecting custom hardware that can generate UART signals, attackers can inject arbitrary commands or responses into existing communications. This might involve:
- Transmitting during specific timing windows, such as immediately after reset
- Sending break signals to interrupt normal operation
- Spoofing responses to queries from the main processor
These techniques often require precise timing and may need specialized hardware like microcontrollers or FPGAs programmed to monitor and inject UART traffic at specific moments.

**Man-in-the-middle setups** provide full visibility and modification capabilities for UART communications. By intercepting communications between components using a device like an FTDI chip connected to two UARTs simultaneously (one to each endpoint), traffic can be captured, modified, or generated on demand. This approach is particularly effective when UART connects multiple subsystems within a device, allowing the researcher to impersonate either endpoint and manipulate the conversation between components.

**Bus monitoring over extended periods** can reveal patterns and sensitive information not immediately obvious. Some vulnerabilities only manifest during specific operations or states:
- During firmware updates when security might be temporarily reduced
- When processing user authentication where credentials might be exposed
- During network configuration where keys or certificates might be accessed
- At specific times of day when maintenance operations occur
Leaving monitoring equipment connected for days while cycling the device through different operational modes can reveal these time-dependent vulnerabilities.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Router Debug Access

Many consumer routers expose UART interfaces that provide direct root access, bypassing all web interface authentication:

1. Locate the UART header pins (often labeled J1, J2, DEBUG or similar)
2. Connect GND, TX, RX to your USB-UART adapter (typically 3.3V logic levels)
3. Set terminal to 115200 8N1 (common for router platforms)
4. Power on the router while capturing boot messages
5. Interrupt the boot sequence when prompted
6. Use bootloader commands to examine the environment:
   ```
   printenv
   ```
7. Proceed with boot but modify Linux boot parameters to gain root access:
   ```
   setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/mtdblock2 rootfstype=squashfs init=/bin/sh
   boot
   ```

This process often yields a root shell without any password authentication, providing complete control over the device.

### Example 2: IoT Device Firmware Extraction

UART access can facilitate firmware extraction from devices with protected storage:

1. Identify and connect to the UART interface
2. Access the bootloader by interrupting the boot sequence
3. Use memory examination commands to locate and dump firmware:
   ```
   md.b 0x80000000 1000    # Examine memory at address
   dump memory 0x80000000 0x81000000 firmware.bin  # Save to file
   ```
4. Alternatively, many bootloaders include flash reading commands:
   ```
   nand read 0x82000000 0 0x800000   # Read NAND flash to RAM
   fatwrite mmc 0 0x82000000 firmware.bin 0x800000  # Write to SD card
   ```

The extracted firmware can then be analyzed offline to discover vulnerabilities, hardcoded credentials, or other security issues.

## Countermeasures

To mitigate UART security risks in your own designs:

1. **Disable debug ports** in production firmware
2. **Implement authentication** for UART console access
3. **Use dedicated debug chips** that can be permanently disabled after manufacturing
4. **Encrypt sensitive data** in boot logs and debug output
5. **Apply proper input validation** to all command parameters
6. **Consider physical protection** like conformal coating over UART test points

For comprehensive protection, UART interfaces should receive the same security scrutiny as any external network interface, despite their physical nature.

## Practical UART Hacking Exercise

### Finding and Connecting to a Router's UART

**Equipment needed:**
- Router (old/unused)
- USB-UART adapter

1. **Disable in production**: Use hardware or software methods to disable UART
2. **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication for debug interfaces
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in boot logs and debug messages
4. **Physical protection**: Make UART pins difficult to access
5. **Remove debug headers**: Don't include debug headers in production boards

## Conclusion

UART interfaces represent one of the most valuable entry points for hardware security research, often providing direct access to device internals that would otherwise remain inaccessible. The simplicity and ubiquity of this protocol make it an ideal starting point for those entering the hardware hacking field.

As embedded systems continue to proliferate throughout our digital infrastructure, the security implications of exposed UART interfaces remain significant. Manufacturers frequently prioritize development convenience and manufacturing testability over security, leaving these powerful debug interfaces active in production devices. For hardware security researchers, this oversight provides a golden opportunity to examine and improve device security.

Mastering UART identification, connection, and analysis techniques establishes a foundation upon which more advanced hardware security skills can be built. The methodologies described in this section transfer readily to other hardware interfaces, while the insights gained through UART exploration often reveal systemic security design issues applicable across entire product lines.

As you progress in your hardware hacking journey, remember that responsible security research involves proper disclosure of vulnerabilities to manufacturers, allowing them to address issues before public revelation. The skills developed through UART exploration can contribute significantly to improving the security of the devices we increasingly depend upon in our connected world.
